# PVA
Everyone's favorite verbal abuse app is back, better than ever! Here's what's new: <br>
- Rather than a shitty python script, PVA is now a full-fledged electron application that runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux!
- PVA now supports multiple types of timers- Regular (you choose an amount of minutes), Pomodoro, and Random (randomly yells at you)
- Featuring many customized alarm sounds- Classic, EAS Alarm, and Unicorn on Ketamine, with more on the way!
- 3 levels of verbal abuse: 1 is very light and pretty much doesn't count as abuse. 2 is a little harder and could probably be considered abuse. 3 goes absolutely ballistic on you and is not for the faint of heart
